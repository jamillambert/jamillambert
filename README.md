I studied computer science (mostly c++ and Java) and physics for my undergrad at Sydney University, then went on to do honours and a PhD in physics.  After university I worked for 12 years using c++, Python, Octave (MatLab) and LabView to write software to analyse measurement data and Python to script analysis of measurements and for the treatment planning system Raystation as part of my job in medical physics in proton therapy. I recently decided to move full time into software engineering and have been spending my time honing my coding skills in particular Python, Rust, and programming Bitcoin.
