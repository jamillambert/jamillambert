I studied computer science (mostly c++ and Java) and physics for my undergrad at Sydney University, then went on to do honours and a PhD in physics.  After university I worked in medical physics in proton therapy for 12 years where where I continued using c++ to write software to analyse measurement data and Python to script analysis of measurements and for the treatment planning system Raystation. In June this year my company went into receivership and I became redundant.  I am now retraining as a software engineer, in particular learning Python, Rust, and programming Bitcoin.
