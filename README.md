Studied computer science (including c++ and Java) and physics at Sydney University, then went on to do honours and a PhD.

Worked for over 15 years using c++, Python (NumPY, Pandas), Octave (MATLAB) and LabVIEW to write software to analyse measurement data and Python to write scripts for the treatment planning system Raystation while working as a medical physicist in proton therapy.

Recently decided to move full time into software engineering and worked independently honing coding skills in particular Python, Rust, and programming Bitcoin.
