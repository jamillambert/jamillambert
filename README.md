I am in the process of setting up GitHub and will fill in this page in the near future.

I studied computer science and physics for my undergrad then went on to do honours and a PhD in physics.  After Uni I worked in medical physics in proton therapy for 12 years until my company went into receivership and I became redundant.  I am now retraining as a software engineer.
